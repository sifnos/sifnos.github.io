### Villages
 
The capital of Sifnos is **Apollonia**. The island’s nightlife takes place in the notorious cobbled street named ‘’Steno’’.  In Appolonia you will find ATMs, a large pharmacy, various pastry shops, coffee shops where you can enjoy a succulent breakfast.
 
 **Artemonas** is the island’s elegant village with beautiful houses and traditional mansions. I suggest you visit the cobbled streets late in the afternoon. Artemonas is the new trend where you can now find good restaurants and an enjoy a relaxing, gastronomic evening. 
 
In between Artemonas et Apollonia you shall find the village of **Ano Petali**. It is worth visiting on foot going from Artemonas to Apollonia. Level: Easy
 
The island’s port is called **Kamares**. Despite the fact that most Cycladic ports are rather dull and present no interest to visitors, Kamares has a beautiful sandy beach, quality restaurants and small shops. 
 
**Kastro** is the island’s historic capital. A place you shouldn’t miss! Ideally, you should visit Kastro during sunset and walk the narrow street to the picturesque churh of Eptamartyro. The whole landscape is rather unique. Continue exploring the vibrant fortressed village and lose yourself to its unique architecture and location.
 
 
### Beaches
 
**Platis Gialos**: A beautiful, sandy beach. The ideal location to relax either at 
Palmira beach bar or at the Mostra bar at the other end of the beach.
 
**Vathy**: Another sandy beach. You should find refuge either under a tamarisk tree next to the Elies Resort Hotel or at the left-hand side of the beach and be by yourself.
 
**Tsopos**: A very small sandy gulf next to Vathy where you will litteraly be all alone. The easiest way to reach Tsopos is to follow the ‘Tsopos’ road sign. Park your car in the land covered by olive trees and walk to the beach which is hidden behind a big rock!
 
**Kamares**: The beach at the port. A beautiful, sandy beach you should visit. The best location to go for a swim is next to the Isalos gastrorestaurant or at the beach’s opposite side right next to the Old Captains restaurant.
 
**Chrissopigi**: The landscape at this beach is mesmerizing despite the difficulty getting into the sea due to the schist rocks at the beachfront. The best place to sit and enjoy the view and the beach is in the middle of the beach, right next to the Tsapis tavern.
 
**Glyfo**: A tiny gulf with really cold waters. Numerous tamarisk trees are waiting for you, but you better arrive as early as possible as it’s a rather small, crowded beach. The best location is on the left-hand side of the beach. To arrive to Glyfo take the road to Faros where you will find a spacious parking area for your car and/ or scooter. Faros is also worth visiting for a swim but as it is a family beach with children it is rather noisy.
 
**Heronissos**: A small fisherman’s village. If it’s not crowded, it’s worth going for a swim.
 
**Eptamartyres**: If the wind is not blowing really hard it is the ideal place to dive from the rocks. The place is magic the least I can say. My advice: go for a swim late in the afternoon.
 
 
 
### Food
 
**Troulaki**: Direction Heronissos. I suggest you combine this short gastronomic trip with a swim in Kamares. This small hidden restaurant found refuge under the sunset: great local meat dishes listening to Hadjidakis and Beethoven. Do not miss this place !
 
**Camaron à Kamares**: Pizza, salads and pasta. Great value for money 
 
**Simos à Kamares**: Cooked, grilled and boiled dishes. Large portions. Low prices.
 
**Meropi à Kamares**: Idem
 
**Leonidas à Kastro**: A little bit more expensive but really nice dishes. My favourite ones are chickpeas in the oven and moussaka.
 
**Astro à Kastro**: A tavern with nice cooked and grilled dishes. A decent option.
 
**Kelari à Kato Petali**: Not easy to locate but still a nice family-run restaurant with really nice dishes. Chickpeas in the oven and mastelo.
 
**Tsikali**: During your swim at Vathy you should absolutely walk to the end of the beach and eat at Tsikali next to the Aghios Taxiarchis beach. A family-run restaurant, an island trademark.
 
**Drakakis**: Appetizers and dishes to share drinking the notorious rakomelo in Appolonia. Drakakis is only open evening hours. All plates are really delicious. It’s the island’s meeting point so try to arrive early in the evening. 
 
**Mosaiko**: A great variety of gastronomic appetizers and dishes in Artemonas; portions are decent not big but it will do the trick. Ask for the daily dessert. 
 
**Omega 3**: Extra, super gourmet and so rather expensive. It’s up to you to decide. One of the best places on the island. Ideally, you should book a table round sunset and enjoy the view while eating succulent dishes at Platis Gialos.
 
**Mama Mia**: Fine Italian cuisine, rather expensive but truly amazing food.
 
 
### Useful tips and secrets !
 
Marzipans and nougats at **Grigoris** pastry shop in  Artemonas. Everything is excellent.
 
While you visit the island listen to **RadioActive 91,3**
 
Breakfast at **Rabagas**. Combo breakfast 12 Euros, a real value for money. 
 
I personally go for a drink to **Doloma**, **Mantalou** and Rabagas. You will find plenty of bars in Steno. The **Botzi** bar is an excellent choice equally. 
 
Do not miss Kostas the Cuban. His notorious bar **Κavos** is in Kastro. We say “let’s go to Kostas Place or Ko the Banana man”. Lost for words, go and see for yourself. 
 
 
**Kitrino Podilato** in Artemonas is the ideal place to enjoy a dessert where the chocolate cake is absolutely amazing.
 
 
If you need something sweet after the late drinks in Steno, you should either visit the **3 Blond Angels** for some deep-fried donuts or rice pudding (!) or the little **Gerontopoulos** pastry shop and enjoy an ice cream.
 
While you visit Troulaki, drive to **Aghios Simeon** and enjoy the breathtaking view overlooking the Aegean Sea. If  you arrive on the remote mountainous area when the boat approaches the port of Kanarese you will see an impressive scenery.
 
You can buy **ceramics** everywhere. It’s up to you to decide. 
 
It’s worth visiting the local churches during the Summer  **christian festivities**. ask the locals for more information. 
 
 
Free open air cinema in Artemonas ! The program of scheduled fils can be found in the portal **Cine Dragatsi**.
 
Delightful desserts in  **Konaki** at Kastro. 
 
You won’t find good souvlaki in Sifnos. I’d say that the souvlaki in **Peratzada** is decent.
